        DataRobot runs this hook when the task is being trained inside a blueprint.

        The input parameters are passed by DataRobot based on project and blueprint configuration.

        Parameters
        -------
        X: pd.DataFrame
            Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
        y: pd.Series
            Project's target column.
        row_weights: np.ndarray (optional, default = None)
            A list of weights. DataRobot passes it in case of smart downsampling or when weights column is specified in project settings.

        Returns
        -------
        CustomTask
            returns an object instance of class CustomTask that can be used in chained method calls
